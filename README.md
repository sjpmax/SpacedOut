# Spaced Out: DORK's Guide to Not Dying in Space

A space survival crafting game built in Unity where you're a band member whose tour ship exploded, now drifting through a debris field collecting resources to build your way to safety.

## ðŸŽ® Game Concept

**Genre:** Space Survival Crafting with Comedy  
**Platform:** Unity (PC)  
**Core Loop:** Jump off platform â†’ Collect debris â†’ Build ship â†’ Survive longer â†’ Reach Federation Hub

## ðŸš€ Current Status

**Development Phase:** Week 1 Complete âœ…  
**Next Milestone:** Tether System Implementation  

### Completed Features
- âœ… Platform movement (constant forward velocity toward Federation Hub)
- âœ… Player movement with Input System (WASD + Space)
- âœ… Momentum-based space physics (jump off platform, coast, retract)
- âœ… Tether system (visual line connecting player to platform)
- âœ… Debris spawning system (scattered at strategic distances)
- âœ… Basic collection mechanics

### Controls
- **WASD** - Move player while on platform / Aim jump direction
- **Space** - Jump off platform (when close) / Retract to platform (when far)

## ðŸŽ­ Story & Characters

**You:** A band member with mysterious memory loss from an exploded tour ship  
**DORK:** "Droid Offering Reliable Knowledge" - Your sarcastic rental robot companion  
**Setting:** The Zephyrian Debris Field - remains of planet Aquatica Prime (destroyed 1000 years ago during their first space launch)

## ðŸš§ Development Notes

Following "ugly but functional" prototype approach:
- Gray cubes and basic shapes for all objects
- No textures or fancy visuals during core mechanics development
- Focus on gameplay feel before art polish

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Metrics

- **Time to first successful grab:** < 30 seconds
- **Tutorial completion rate:** > 80%
- **Frame rate:** Stable 60 FPS
- **Core loop satisfaction:** "One more jump" feeling
